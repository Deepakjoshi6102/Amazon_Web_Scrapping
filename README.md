# Amazon_Web_Scrapping
Hello Folks, I have created this project as a part of hackathon hosted by Pepcoding Education Private Limited . 
In this project I m going to use Puppeteer to build an app that is able to scrape dynamic websites, 
like Amazon. Technologies which I have used is 1 Puppeteer 2 nodejs 3 nodemailer 4 cron 
The idea is that app will run in the background, and use web scraping to check 
the price of selected product on Amazon. Every single hour app will check 
if the price has dropped below some value, if so, the app will send 
us an email with notification. Gmail- deepakjoshi6102@gmail.com 
Thanks to Sumeet Malik Sir for providing this opportunity. #jobdriveslearning #javascript #nodejs #opportunity #project
